# React Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
It showcases my skills, projects, education, and contact details in a clean and responsive layout.

The goal of this project was to build a simple, professional portfolio without unnecessary animations or overdesign, focusing on clarity and usability.
